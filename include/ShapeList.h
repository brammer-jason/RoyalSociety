/**
* My implementation of the linked list, designed to work with Shapes.
*
* This class contains two subclasses, a Node, and an Iterator. The node contains
* pointers to its specified Shape, and also a pointer to the next Node. The iterator
* is responsible for iterating through the entire list and returning members as
* necessary
* 
* Satisfies most of goal A.
